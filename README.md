#1 Given an array A of N positive integers and another number X. Determine whether or not there exist two elements in A whose sum is exactly X.

Input: 6 16
1 4 45 6 10 8
Output: Yes

#2 A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5. First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.
Write a function to find the nth Magic number.

Input: n = 2
Output: 25

Input: n = 5
Output: 130 

#3 A number is called faithful if you can write it as the sum of distinct powers of 7. 
e.g.,  2457 = 7 + 72 + 74 . If we order all the faithful numbers, we get the sequence 1 = 70, 7 = 71, 8 = 70 + 71, 49 = 72, 50 = 70 + 72 . . . and so on.
Given some value of N, you have to find the N'th faithful number.
